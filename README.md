## Project Description

</p>

  Jibril is a single/multi-player word game where players test their vocabulary against time or other players. It is based on a Japanese word game called "Shiritori," where players take turns saying a word that begins with the last character of the previous word. In this game, players type a word that begins with the last letter of the previous word, either against the clock (Single player) or against other players (Versus mode).

- Using a word that does not start with the last letter of the reference/previous word is invalid.
- Only words from the English language are acceptable.
- Score is based on the number of letters in each word that is correctly played.

## General Rules

- Players can customize the game duration and the time limit per turn.

## Features

**Jibril** has two main features:

### Single Player Mode

In this mode, players race against themselves to score as many words as they can within the given time limit. Longer words yield higher scores.

### Versus Mode

Players can compete against each other in a two-player game. They can customize game rules such as game duration and time limit per turn. The player who complies with the rules and achieves the highest score wins.

## About Us

We are a group of computer engineering students from Polytechnic University of the Philippines who are aspiring to be professional engineers. **Jibril** is the result of our passion and interest in game development. We aim to provide a fun, enjoyable, and entertaining game while also promoting learning through vocabulary challenges.

## Gameplay

The main gameplay involves taking the last letter of the initial word and creating another word from it. Players must adhere to five rules:

1. Answer within the time limit.
2. Avoid repeating used words.
3. Spell words correctly.
4. Use a word that starts with the last letter of the initial word.
5. Use only English words.

There are two game modes:

### Single Player

Players race against the time limit, entering words complying with the rules. The time limit decreases with each round.

</p>

### Versus Mode

Players interact and play with each other, customizing game settings. The game automatically randomizes the order of player turns. Failure to comply with the rules results in a loss for that player.

## Concepts and Ideas

Some considerations for future development include:

1. Increasing the maximum number of players in multiplayer mode.
2. Adding a "Pass" command for players to skip a turn.
3. Allowing players to make a limited number of mistakes.
